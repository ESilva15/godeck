# GODECK
This is a simple client for NextCloud's Deck app.

It features a CLI that implements mostly all features available in the Deck's
RestAPI.
It can already be used for simple automations since it can output JSON that
can be piped to other programs.

The goal of the project is to provide a TUI.
